## About

This README file contains steps to enable QNN GStreamer plugin(s)

## Instructions

1. Enable QNN Distro
    - Add 'qti-qnn' to 'DISTRO_FEATURES' list in the distro conf file
        ```
        DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " qti-qnn"
        OR
        DISTRO_FEATURES += "qti-qnn"
        ```
        Note the space in _append command.

2. Download QNN package and unzip it.

3. Incorporate the downloaded and unzipped QNN package into the workspace.
    - Create folders 'files/qnn' in '<path-to-workspace>/poky/meta-qti-ml-prop/recipes/qnn-sdk/'
        ```bash
        mkdir -p <path-to-workspace>/poky/meta-qti-ml-prop/recipes/qnn-sdk/files/qnn
        ```
    - Copy the unzipped QNN package folder to '<path-to-workspace>/poky/meta-qti-ml-prop/recipes/qnn-sdk/files/qnn/'
        ```bash
        cp -r <path-to-unzipped-QNN>/* <path-to-workspace>/poky/meta-qti-ml-prop/recipes/qnn-sdk/files/qnn/
        ```
    - The final directory structure should look like - <path-to-workspace>/poky/meta-qti-ml-prop/recipes/qnn-sdk/files/qnn/

4. Rebuild the image and flash the image to device
